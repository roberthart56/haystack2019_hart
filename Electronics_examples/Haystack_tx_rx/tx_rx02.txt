//  One conductor attached to pin4, one to A0
//
//  Optionally, two resistors (1 MOhm or greater) can be placed between 5V and GND, with
//  the signal connected between them so that the steady-state voltage is 2.5 Volts.
//
//  Signal varies with electric field coupling between conductors, and can
//  be used to measure many things related to position, overlap, and intervening material
//  between the two conductors.

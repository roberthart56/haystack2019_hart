##Sensing with Step Response (transmit-receive, or tx-rx)


  - [Arduino sketch for tx_rx](./tx_rx01.txt)  Single measurement.

  - [Arduino sketch for tx_rx](./rx_tx02.txt)  Average of N points.  Has the algorithm built into the loop function.

  - [Arduino sketch with function for tx_rx](./rx_tx03.txt)  Has the algorithm in a separate function, to make coding easier.

  - [Arduino sketch including rgb LED](./tx_rx_rgb.txt)  Single measurement.

  - Here's how it works:

    - transmit (tx) pin is made alternately high (5V) and low (0V).
    - This charges and discharges the tx electrode.
    - On the rx electrode there is a small 'blip' up or down as the tx pin toggles.
    - These blips are measured by the Arduino analog input (ADC), and "low" subracted from "high" (see figure).
    - This result varies depending on how closely the two plates are coupled by the electric field.  It increases as the distance decreases and also
    changes with the amount of overlap and the material between the plates.

   Above is a sketch of the setup for tx-rx sensing.  The (optional) resistors between 5V and GND make the signal stabler.  The input
   to the ADC is attached to the point halfway betwen 5V and ground, and is therefore at 2.5 volts, except for the transient
   blips that occur at the tx electrode changes voltage.  These resistors should be equal and greater than 1 Mega Ohm.
